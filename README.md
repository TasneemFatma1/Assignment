Step 1: Download and Import the Excel File- First, download the Excel file provided to you and upload it to your working environment. Ensure the file name and path are correctly referenced in your code. If you change the name or location of the file, ensure to update the file_path variable accordingly.
Step 2- Loaded each sheet into DataFrame, followed by that seen all the dataset using the head(), information about the DataFrame, missing values in DataFrame and replaced the missing values of rating column of OrderDetails with the median value as median is less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean. Then ensured column names are consistent and easy to reference. Merged the DataFrame based on common columns and then dropped the duplicate columns from the DataFrame i.e user_id, session_id.
Step 3- The analysis of orders per session reveals that each session corresponds to exactly one order, as all session IDs have only one unique order ID. Regarding the relationship between session ratings and order placements, there is a varying number of orders placed for different session ratings, with higher ratings (4.3 to 4.9) associated with more orders. Higher session ratings may correlate with more orders, suggesting that improving session quality and user satisfaction could lead to increased orders.
Step 4- The most popular dishes based on order frequency are Spaghetti and Grilled Chicken, both ordered 4 times, followed by Caesar Salad with 3 orders. Pancakes and Veggie Burger have 2 orders each.
Step 5- The analysis of orders by age group shows that customers aged 28, 30, 35, and 42 placed the most orders, while some age groups like 29 and 33 had no orders. The location-based analysis indicates that Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and other major cities had the highest number of orders, while Dallas and Phoenix had no orders.
Step 6- I have made few visualizations that provide valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors. Orders by age group reveal that certain age groups have higher engagement, with peak orders in specific ranges. Location-based analysis shows varying order volumes across cities, highlighting areas for targeted marketing. Popular dishes are visualized, with clear favorites standing out, while meal type distribution is shown through a pie chart. The heatmap displays top dishes across different locations, offering insights for regional promotions. The average session rating by location shows performance across regions, and the orders by time of day reveal peak ordering times, which can guide operational strategies.
